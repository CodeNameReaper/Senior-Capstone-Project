            <h3>Checking Oil Level</h3>
            <p>Checking your oil daily or weekly is very important. This will tell you if you have a leak or your vehicle is burning oil. In addition, always check your parking place to see
                if you have oil spots on the ground. That is an idication that you have a oil leak and will continue until it is fixed. Don't wait until the check engine light or low Pressure
                light comes on to address this issue.
            </p>

            <h3>Cecking the Power Steering Level</h3>
            <p>Power steering helps with making it easier to steer your vehicle. Just like oil, check your spot for leaks. If there is a red fluid on the side of the power steering pump,
                this is an indication that there is a power steering leak. Other factor are noises coming from the power steering pump and it will be hard to steer. Try to catch this ahead 
                of time and either fix it or take it to a mechanic shop. This will prevent you from getting stranded on the road.

            <h3>Checking Windshield Washer FLuid</h3>
            <p>Checking your windshield washer fluid is just as easy as any other fluid. Since you are under your hood checking your other fluids, check the level of your
                windshield washer fluid. This helps with bugs that hit your windshield, mug or even dust from the country roads on your windshiled. It is the most important 
                for a driver to have a full visual view. This is the most inexpensive cost check to do.

            <h3>Checking Brake Fluid Level</h3>
            <p>Brake fluid is important because it can not only take away from braking but cause more problems with the anti-brake system (ABS). Low fluid can cause the ABS light
                to come on and/or loss of traction. It is better to catch leaks or a fault in the braking system before you are stranded. If it is more than low fluid, take it to a 
                mechanic shop to get looked at.
        </div>
    
        <div class="course-col">
            <img src="project/coolant.jpg" class="coolant">
            <h3>Checking the Coolant Level</h3>
            <p>Check your coolant level when the vehicle is cold. Never check it when it's hot because there is pressure built up in the system. This can cause bodily harm.
                When checking cold, make sure that the level of the radiator fluid level is above the inner fins for proper cooling. Next, the over flow tank or coolant resevoir
                should only be at the max level because pressure still needs to build and breathe. There is a reason why there is a minimum and a maximum level.
            </p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <img src="project/tires.jpg" class="tires">
            <h3>Checking the Tire Pressure</h3>
            <p>All vehicles come with specifications decal located on the driver side door jam or also in the cars service manual. These tire pressures are relevant to the 
                specifications from the manufactures specifications and not for after market tires. In addition, the tire pressure can also be found on the sidewall of each
                tire with the "max pressure" indicated. However, each vehicle tire pressure system is programmed to read the manufactures specifications to let the driver
                know when a tire is low on pressure bfore it becomes flat. It is wise to stick to the manufactures specifications.
